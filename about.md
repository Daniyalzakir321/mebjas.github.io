## `now()` Software Engineer III @Google
> âš“ Singapore, May 2019 to present

I work for a team called **[NBU: Next Billion Users](https://www.blog.google/technology/next-billion-users)** where we build technologies for emerging markets. In these markets, resource-constrained Android devices are very popular. These days I spend most of my time writing code to deliver seamless user experiences for such devices => thus for all markets.

 > TIL: Did you know a 1Gb Android device only has ~880Mb of available RAM of which only about ~450 Mb is left for applications to run on? [Learn about carveout memory in Linux](https://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/carveout-memory-(linux))

#### Areas I work on these days
 - Android, Android Fundamentals, Android Camera, Android storage
 - Linux Fundamentals, Memory management in Android
 - Image Processing
 
## `now(-1)` - Software Engineer II at Microsoft
> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Hyderabad, India, June 2016 to May 2019

I worked with **Microsoft Azure** for around 3 years. My day to day involved applied data science, Azure cloud services, distributed systems and some part of Azure UI. My team was working on an intelligent alerting platform in Azure on features like Smart Grouping capable of automatically grouping user alerts from different sources to reduce mean time to mitigation for customers. Another interesting project I had an opportunity to work on was: designing and implementing a high availability architecture for the Azure Alerting platform targetting 4 9's of availability (99.99% Uptime). The effort was centered around making Alerting Service in Azure resilient to even regional Azure Datacenter outages.

> Did you know 99.99% availability means only acceptable downtime of only **4m 23.0s** per month :O

#### Areas I worked on:
 - Applied ML, Unsupervised Learning, Bayesian Networks, Knowledge Graphs
 - Distributed Systems, Systems design, High Availability
