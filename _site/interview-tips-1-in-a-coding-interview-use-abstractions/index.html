   <p>While I was working with Microsoft, I had opportunity to take around 10 – 20 coding or design interviews (candidates with 1 – 12 years of experience). There was this one thing that I felt was too common, which would lead to bad impression and potential rejection – it’s that the candidate attempts to solve every part of the question rather than focusing on what is important. This is particularly prevalent amongst candidates who chose C / C++ as programming language of choice. And, this was common irrespective of years of experience.</p>
<p>Here’s an example – <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/">165 – Compare version numbers</a></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Given two version numbers for example “1.4.5” and “1.3.6” return the greater one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is a fairly simple question when first looked at – however, it has some ambiguity that you need to resolve. But yes that’s not the focus of this post. When I present this question, before the candidate is about to start coding – I explicitly mention:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Please feel free to use as much abstraction as needed, if there is something particular I am interested in I’ll dig into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course with this sober simple face.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image1.jpeg" alt="My sober face" width="500px" /><br /></p>
<p>Now, amongst other possible approach the one that is most general is to split the string on “.” as a delimiter and convert the values to integer and then compare left to right, assuming the given value is a valid version number. I have seen many spend time on the first sub problem</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>splitting and converting to integer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience I have seen folks attempt it as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image5.png" alt="python approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>So far only one person chose to go with Python – and the kind of syntaxes that are available makes it super easy to deal with these kinda things.</em></span></p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image3.png" alt="dotnet approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>A DotNet person may go around this way.</em></span></p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image2.png" alt="c++ approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>And this is how majority of folks using C++ have dealt with the question. Many of them seemed to struggle to correctly implement this sub logic.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Now as an Interviewer</strong> - This gives me a very bad first impression. When I give a question to a candidate, amongst other things I am judging how it’d be like to have:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The candidate in my team working on a project along with me.</li>
 <li>Doing my code reviews</li>
 <li>Pushing code to production which we maintain.</li>
 <li>Have high level discussions with this person</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d want the other person to talk important things and dig as needed – more like use as much abstraction as needed. This may be subjective, but this is how I may answer things and would expect similar approach from an experienced candidate.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image7.png" alt="python expected approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>Python: As an interviewer this shows me that the candidate modularise well, can focus on important part of discussion. And if needed, I can ask them to implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validate()</code> method – if the time permits, thus resulting in a clean modular code at the end of interview. It’s a WIN.</em></span></p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image4.png" alt="dotnet expected approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>C#: I’d expect a simple private method that takes care of the sub problems. The implementation is also not necessary in the first approach.</em></span></p>
<p><img src="/images/post10_image6.png" alt="c++ expected approach" width="750px" /><br />
<span class="image-caption"><em>C++: This is how I expect candidates to go ahead with his question. There is no need to implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ConverToIntVector()</code> method in the first approach.</em></span></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The major idea I wish to share here is for candidates to focus on problem at hand and not try to solve all the sub problems unless explicitly asked. <strong>There is a limited time at hand to show your best</strong>.</p>
<p>If you feel this is too subjective opinion, share it over comments – I’d like to learn and grow further as an interviewer myself.</p>

            I am working with Next Billion Users Org at Google. My team builds technologies for emerging markets.
            I feel, the goal of delivering cutting edge technologies to resource constrained devices with seamless performance is hard, at times frustating but worthwhile.
            Hoping for positive impact, good Karma and unbounded learning ;)
